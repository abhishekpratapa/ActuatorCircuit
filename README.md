# ActuatorCircuit
This repository is for an actuator circuit design that can be used in opening and closing valves, controlling a light show, fireworks, sprinklers, using a controlled sequences of on and off controls. 

<h2>Ideation</h2>
So a friend of mine was designing an automated controller to use in a startup, it was to control a series of valves in a particular sequence. So I decided to prototype the device shown below in a lunch break.

<h2>The Initial Prototype</h2>

<h3>Notes</h3>
Notes on the circuit diagram above

-Orange:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outputs to Relays, in this case LED's <br/>
-Green:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inputs from buttons, buttons are debounced in the hardware <br/>
-Black:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground <br/>
-Red:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5V <br/>
