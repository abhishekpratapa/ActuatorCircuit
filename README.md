# ActuatorCircuit
This repository is for an actuator circuit design that can be used in opening and closing valves, controlling a light show, fireworks, sprinklers, using a controlled sequences of on and off controls. 

<h2>Ideation</h2>
So a friend of mine was designing an automated controller to use in a startup, it was to control a series of valves in a particular sequence. So I decided to prototype the device shown below in a lunch break.
